    <p class="p"><b>Lorem ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
      the
      industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
      it to make a type specimen book. It
      has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It
      was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with
      desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
